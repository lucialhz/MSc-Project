\section{ARM TrustZone}

\subsection{An introduction to ARM TrustZone}

ARM TrustZone is a method used to separate “secure” applications from non-secure ones in two separate worlds, where memory can be designated as secure or not secure. Execution is transferred from each world either through interrupts or direct function calls. ARM TrustZone is very well described by Ngabonziza et al \cite{Ngabonziza2017}.

Secure world TrustZone applications have access to normal world memory, this will enable static attestation.A secure world application would need to supply the normal world application with a nonce to make sure the response is not a replay.

Provisioning is an interesting aspect which I haven’t quite worked out out.
