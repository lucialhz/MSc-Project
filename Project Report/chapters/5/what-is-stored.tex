\section{What is stored}

\subsection{Other running processes}

When implemented on an OS, the save will query the running processes from the OS and add them to the control-flow manifest. Query process IDs will be a different process between operating systems, so we will evaluate which OS will potentially be used prior to finalising the process.

While there has been some work done in regards to CFG, we will need to investigate this further.

\subsubsection{Variables}

We will implement a function where the software can assert (send information to secure world on) variables in use either when saving or as an additional instruction through the solution's API. External data or internal data will be tracked using asserts.

\subsubsection{Previous hash}

A hash chain will be built to prove the control-flow was tied to the previous control flow and the static attestation report.
