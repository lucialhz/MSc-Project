In this chapter we first aim to provide the theoretical information required to implement a solution which enables audit of control-flow integrity. Initially we discuss the methods for constructing of CFGs. We then examine how to trace the control-flow at run time, including how a chain of transitions would be created. We also consider the problematic areas of control-flow tracking\slash monitoring, using prior work discussed throughout this project as guidance. Finally, additional contents of audit files such as concurrent processes or important variables, are detailed.
