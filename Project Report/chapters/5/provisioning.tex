\section{Provisioning}

\subsection{Instrumentation}

The existing binary will be instrumented either prior to loading or during the loading (bootloading process). Instrumentation means replacing instructions from the compiled code with ones which are used for attestation.

\subsection{Initial attestation}

All software will be scrutinised with an initial attestation upon initial commissioning.

\subsection{Secure world}

Secure world applications need to be signed before they are loaded (reference some sort of ARM document).
