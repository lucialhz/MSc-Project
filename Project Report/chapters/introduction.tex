Ideas:

``Virtual Binding of Hardware to Software of Embedded Systems through 2-Way Remote Attestation''

Use remote attestation of static and control flow to keep device in running state.

2 - way: Server sends remote attestation request, device responds with hash of completed signal path somehow along with static hash of software. Device requests current hash or something like that from server and compares to local value. If fails it stops function of software and reverts to simple operating mechanism (such as timed traffic lights).
