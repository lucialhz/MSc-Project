\section{Project Structure}

This project will be broken down into three sections. Chapter \ref{chapterCFI} describes Control-Flow Integrity including construction of control-flow-graphs, the prevention of CFI corruption, the detection of CFI corruption and how CFI is attested. Chapter \ref{chapterBackground} looks into the background existing literature surrounding the subject. Chapter \ref{chapterComparison} identifies some key requirements we need and compares the existing solutions against them. Chapter \ref{chapterTheoreticalSolution} will describe the theory behind the the proposed solution. In chapter \ref{chapterSecurityAnalysis} we will perform a security evaluation on the proposed solution. Chapter \ref{chapterConclusion} will provide the conclusion and a recommendation for directions for further work.
