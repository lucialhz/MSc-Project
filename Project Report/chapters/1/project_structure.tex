\section{Project Structure}

This project will be broken down into four sections: the first section, chapters 1-3, describe the problem this project aims to address and introduces the central concepts relating to the project; the second section, chapter 4, compares the leading solutions in the field of control-flow attestation and static attestation; the third section, chapter 5, details a description of the proposed solution; finally in the last section, chapters 6-7, we perform a security analysis of the proposed solution and conclude the project.

Chapter \ref{chapterCFI} provides an introduction to embedded systems and a detailed examination of control-flow integrity (including construction of control-flow-graphs and the prevention and detection of CFI corruption). Chapter \ref{chapterBackground} performs a review of the background literature surrounding the subject area. Chapter \ref{chapterComparison} identifies key requirements of control-flow integrity and attestation solutions before comparing a selection of solutions to this criteria. It then carries out a similar analysis on solutions designed to provide static attestation. Chapter \ref{chapterTheoreticalSolution} will describe the proposed solution. In chapter \ref{chapterSecurityAnalysis} we will perform a security evaluation on the proposed solution. Chapter \ref{chapterConclusion} will provide the conclusion and a recommendation for directions for further work.
