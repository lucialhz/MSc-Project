\section{Project Structure}

This project will be broken down into three sections. Section 2 describes Control-Flow Integrity including construction of control-flow-graphs, the prevention of CFI corruption, the detection of CFI corruption and how CFI is attested. Section 3 looks into the background existing literature surrounding the subject. Section 4 identifies some key requirements we need and compares the existing solutions against them. Section 5 will describe the theory behind the solution while section 6 will describe the practical implementation. In section 7 we will perform a security evaluation on the proposed solution. Section 8 will provide the conclusion and a recommendation for directions for further work.
