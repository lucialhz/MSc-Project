In this chapter we first introduce the concept of control-flow, describing how it is built up from transitions between basic blocks to form a control-flow graph and how control-flow can be violated. We then look at the types of execution branches which trigger transitions between basic blocks. We explain some important categories of hardware and software attacks which can lead to the subversion of a control-flow. Finally the problem setting for this project is described along with a list of objectives which the proposed solution will be judged against.
