\subsection{Introduction}

In this section we will define the requirements which we will aim to meet with the solution produced as a result of this project. These have been built up using the literature for CFI and attestation methods as well as the the requirements identified from the attack model.

\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Works with compiled binaries: where the original source code does not need adjusting to be compatible with the solution.
	\item Works with external libraries: similar to compatibility with compiled binaries but with the added constraint of no access to the external library source code. 
	\item Can be used to bind software to hardware: this would allow for the solution to that the software running on the devices is the software specially designed and deployed for said device.
	\item Works with embedded systems: a crucial element as the solution is aimed at solving the problem for embedded devices.
	\item Granularity: the solution should (at a minimum) be able to keep track of transition between basic blocks (including direct branches).
\end{enumerate}
