\subsection{Introduction}\label{projectRequirements}

In this section we will define the requirements which we will aim to meet with the solution produced as a result of this project. These have been built up using the literature for CFI and attestation methods as well as the the requirements identified from the attack model.

\subsection{Practical Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Works with compiled binaries: where the original source code does not need adjusting to be compatible with the solution.
	\item Works with external libraries: similar to compatibility with compiled binaries but with the added constraint of no access to the external library source code. 
	\item Works with embedded systems: a crucial element as the solution is aimed at solving the problem for embedded devices.
	\item Granularity: the solution should (at a minimum) be able to keep track of transition between basic blocks (including direct branches).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Requirements}
 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{An attacker must be detected if they change the sequential order of instructions.} Re-ordering instructions can be used to bypass cryptographic protections (similar to ECB vulnerabilities) to achieve the attackers goals.
	\item \textbf{An attacker must be detected if they change the execution order of basic blocks.} Re-ordering BBLs can be used to execute code in a manner which violates the control-flow graph.
	\item \textbf{An attacker must be detected if they skip instructions} Skipping instructions can be used to bypass checks.
	\item \textbf{An attacker must be detected if they subvert control flow to existing code (e.g. return-to-libc)} Subverting control-flow to external existing code could enable an attacker to perform functions not permitted through normal usage of the application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attacker Assumptions}
We assume that attacker may have direct access to memory but not internal registers, they cannot break cryptographic protections and that cryptographic keys can be safely stored.
