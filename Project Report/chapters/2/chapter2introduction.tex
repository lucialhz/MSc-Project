In this chapter we begin by gaining a basic understanding of embedded systems and how they are used. This knowledge is used to frame the project and anchor it towards the constraints of implementing an embedded system-based solution. Control-flow integrity (CFI) is then discussed in deeper detail than when first introduced in this project's introduction and approaches for ensuring the protection of CFI are identified and explored.
