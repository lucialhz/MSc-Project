This chapter is focussed on carrying out comparisons of various solutions related to the project subject matter, this is to assist us in understanding which approaches will be most useful for producing the proposed solution. The first set of solutions to be compared are ones which provide control-flow integrity and control-flow auditing. They will be assessed against a set of pre-determined requirements, and we also compare key properties of the solutions. The second set of solutions are ones which provide static attestation. These will also be compared against a pre-determined set of requirements and properties.
